# ML_Mini_Project

Problem Statement:
Build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a person surviving
the Titanic shipwreck using passenger data such as name, age, gender, and socio-
economic class. The goal is to classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors
based on relevant features in the dataset.

Objectives:
- To predict the survival status of Titanic passengers based on historical data.
- To identify the key features influencing survival rates on the Titanic.
- To build machine learning models with high accuracy for classification.
- To evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall,
and F1 score.

Introduction:
The sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912 led to one of the deadliest maritime
disasters, with over 1500 fatalities. Factors such as age, gender, and socio-
economic class significantly influenced survival rates. Leveraging machine
learning, this project aims to predict which passengers survived the disaster using
a dataset that contains passenger details. Two models, Logistic Regression and
Naive Bayes, are used to classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors.
